# coinbase-pro-clj [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bpringe/coinbase-pro-clj.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bpringe/coinbase-pro-clj)

A Clojure wrapper for the [Coinbase Pro API](https://docs.pro.coinbase.com/) (formerly GDAX). The point of this library is to make it convenient to harness the power of Clojure
for creating cryptocurrency trading bots and similar applications that utilize the [Coinbase Pro exchange](https://pro.coinbase.com). Results are given in edn, and authentication is handled by the library.

## Installation

Add the dependency to your project or build file.

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/coinbase-pro-clj.svg)](https://clojars.org/coinbase-pro-clj)

## Quick Start

Read on for a quick start or jump to the [documentation](https://bpringe.github.io/coinbase-pro-clj/index.html) for a list of all endpoint and websocket functions with links to the Coinbase Pro API docs and code examples for each.

First, require it in the REPL:

```clojure
(require '[coinbase-pro-clj.core :as cp])
```

Or in your application:

```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [coinbase-pro-clj.core :as cp]))
```

### Endpoints

Each function takes in a client, which requires a `:url` and optional authentication values. The authentication values are only required for authenticated endpoints. These can be obtained by logging into [Coinbase Pro](https://pro.coinbase.com) and creating them in the API settings section. URL vars are provided by the library for convenience.

```clojure
(def client {:url cp/rest-url ; Other values include websocket-url, sandbox-rest-url, and sanbox-websocket-url.
             :key "Coinbase Pro key"
             :secret "Coinbase Pro secret"
             :passphrase "Coinbase Pro passphrase"})
```

From here you can call any of the functions (provided your client has a valid key, secret, and passphrase for authenticated endpoints). Here are a few examples:

```clojure
;; Public endpoints
(cp/get-products client)

(cp/get-ticker client "BTC-USD")

;; Private endpoints (require authentication values in client)
(cp/get-orders client)

(cp/place-order client {:side "buy"
                        :product_id "BTC-USD"
                        :price 5000
                        :size 1})
```

### Websocket Feed

When a new connection is created, the heartbeat channel is subscribed to if no `:channels` are specified. The following list describes the callback functions that can be passed to `create-websocket-connection`:

- `:on-receive` - A unary function called when a message is received. The argument is received as edn.
- `:on-connect` - A unary function called after the connection has been established. The argument is a [WebSocketSession](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/javadoc/9.4.8.v20171121/org/eclipse/jetty/websocket/common/WebSocketSession.html).
- `:on-error` - A unary function called in case of errors. The argument is a `Throwable` describing the error.
- `:on-close` - A binary function called when the connection is closed. Arguments are an `int` status code and a `String` description of reason.

```clojure
;; Create a new connection and subscribe to the ticker channel for BTC-USD
(def conn (cp/create-websocket-connection {:product_ids ["BTC-USD" "ETH-USD"]
                                           :channels [{:name "ticker"}]
                                           :url cp/websocket-url
                                           :on-receive (fn [x] (prn 'received x))}))

;; Unsubscribe from the ticker channel for all products
(cp/unsubscribe conn {:channels [{:name "ticker"}]})

;; Subscribe to the heartbeat channel of BTC-USD
(cp/subscribe conn {:channels [{:name "heartbeat"
                                :product_ids ["BTC-USD"]}]})

;; Close the connection
(cp/close conn)
```
