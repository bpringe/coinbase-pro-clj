# coinbase-pro-clj

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bpringe/coinbase-pro-clj.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bpringe/coinbase-pro-clj)

A Clojure wrapper for the Coinbase Pro API (formerly GDAX). This is a WIP. All HTTP endpoints have been mapped, and support for public and private websocket feeds is complete. Tests are also complete. I'm just finishing up the [documentation](https://bpringe.github.io/coinbase-pro-clj/index.html), then I'll upload to clojars.
